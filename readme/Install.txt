INSTALLATION:

Open the Terminal app, and download the latest AppWarden.pkg installer to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/AppWarden/master/SupportFiles/AppWarden.pkg

To install, double-click the downloaded package.


The installer will install the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.appwarden.plist
   /usr/AppWarden/
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-WillLaunch
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-DidLaunch
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-DidTerminate

There's no need to reboot.

After installation, your computer will write to the log file ~/Library/Logs/AppWarden.log whenever an application launches or quits. 

If the installer fails you should check the installation logs.


MODIFYING THE EXAMPLE SCRIPTS:

After installation, three simple example scripts can be found in the following location:

   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-WillLaunch
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-DidLaunch
   /usr/AppWarden/bin/AppWarden-DidTerminate

These scripts simply write to the log file ~/Library/Logs/AppWarden.log whenever the ConsoleUser changes. Modify the scripts to your own needs.


LOGS:

The example scripts write to the following log file:

	~/Library/Logs/AppWarden.log

The installer writes to the following log file:

	/Library/Logs/com.github.execriez.appwarden.log
  
You should check this log if there are issues when installing.
