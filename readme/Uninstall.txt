UNINSTALLING:


Open the Terminal app, and download the latest AppWarden-Uninstaller.pkg uninstaller to your desktop by typing the following command. 

	curl -k --silent --retry 3 --retry-max-time 6 --fail https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/AppWarden/master/SupportFiles/AppWarden-Uninstaller.pkg --output ~/Desktop/ConsoleUserWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

To uninstall, double-click the downloaded package.

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.appwarden.plist
   /usr/AppWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and application launches will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
