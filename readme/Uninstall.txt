UNINSTALLING:

Download the AppWarden uninstaller package here:

   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/execriez/AppWarden/master/SupportFiles/AppWarden-Uninstaller.pkg

The uninstaller will remove the following files and directories:

   /Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.execriez.appwarden.plist
   /usr/AppWarden/

After the uninstall everything goes back to normal, and application launches will not be tracked.

There's no need to reboot.
